# This template is based off Apple's SingleView project template.

The original project template can be found inside the Xcode.app bundle at:

```
.../Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application/Single View App.xctemplate
```

The project template has been changed to support a SingleView app which uses the Coordinator pattern.  The coordinator pattern was made popular by [Soroush Khanlou](http://khanlou.com).

This project template creates a folder structure that I like to use most often.  You can, obviously, change the folder structure to your liking and needs.
